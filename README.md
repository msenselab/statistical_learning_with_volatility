## Background
Statistical learning to suppress the location(s) of where a salient distractor is likely (vs. unlikely) to occur can enhance visual search efficiency, 
an effect termed distractor-location probability cueing. However, whether this effect is influenced by the volatility of distractor occurrence 
(i.e., of the sequence of distractor-present and -absent events) remains poorly understood. 
Here, we investigated this question by contrasting two volatility regimens in a distractor-location probability-cueing paradigm: 
a low-volatility environment ( distractor-present and -absent trials likely streaked) and a high-volatility environment (two trial types changing frequently).
